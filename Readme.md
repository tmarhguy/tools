A polished, user-friendly **command-line utility collection** designed to house all my frequently used tools in one place. I am not the biggest fan of intrusive online converters with ads, paywalls, and network issues. Everything here runs cleanly and quickly right from the terminal.

## Why this Repository?

**Consolidated Workflow.** Instead of relying on random websites to perform basic tasks like compressing an image, merging files, or converting a video to a GIF, I built this repository to act as a personal "Swiss Army Knife". 

**Polished Experience.** The terminal doesn't have to be boring. These tools are built with user experience in mind, providing clear progress feedback and a clean interface.

## The Mango UI

Run `mango` anywhere to open the interactive hub — pick a category, browse folders, and let Mango guide the conversion. After `./setup.sh --link --yes`, all tools are available globally (`format-json`, `merge-pdf`, `to_gif`, etc.).

</p>

The main menu uses arrow keys — no typing numbers. Pick a category and Mango walks you through the rest.

### Browse to your file

When a tool needs input, Mango doesn't dump you into an empty folder or throw an error. It shows only the subfolders that actually contain matching files, plus any matches in the current directory. Open folders with Enter, go back with `../`, or press **P** to type a path.

### Preview, run, done

Before anything runs, you see exactly what goes in and what comes out. Confirm once, watch it execute, and get a clear result — saved path, file size, and how much space you saved.
